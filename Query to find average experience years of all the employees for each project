Table 1:
CREATE TABLE Project (
    project_id INT,
    employee_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (project_id, employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id)
);

(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to the Employee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with
project_id.

Table 2:
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    experience_years INT
);


employee_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project,
rounded to 2 digits.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.


Input 1 :
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, employee_id) VALUES
(1, 1),
(1, 2),
(1, 3),
(2, 1),
(2, 4);

Input 2 :
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name, experience_years) VALUES
(1, 'Khaled', 3),
(2, 'Ali', 2),
(3, 'John', 1),
(4, 'Doe', 2);

Query :
Select p.project_id,round(avg(e.experience_years),1) as average_years from Employee as e
Inner Join Project as p on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
Group by p.project_id;

Output:
| project_id | average_years |
|____________|_______________|
| 1          |    2          |
| 2          |    2.5        |
