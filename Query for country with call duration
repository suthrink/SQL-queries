    name VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(255)
);

Each row of this table contains the name of a person and their phone number.
Phone number will be in the form 'xxx-yyyyyyy' where xxx is the country code (3 characters) and
yyyyyyy is the phone number (7 characters) where x and y are digits. Both can contain leading zeros

CREATE TABLE Country (
    name VARCHAR(255),
    country_code VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY
);
country_code is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the country name and its code. country_code will be in the form 'xxx'
where x is digits.

CREATE TABLE Calls (
    caller_id INT,
    callee_id INT,
    duration INT
);

There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the caller id, caller id and the duration of the call in minutes. caller_id
!= callee_id
A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. The company intends to invest in
the countries where the average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the
global average call duration.
Write an SQL query to find the countries where this company can invest.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.


INSERT INTO Person (id, name, phone_number) VALUES
(3, 'Jonathan', '051-1234567'),
(12, 'Elvis', '051-7654321'),
(1, 'Moncef', '212-1234567'),
(2, 'Maroua', '212-6523651'),
(7, 'Meir', '972-1234567'),
(9, 'Rachel', '972-0011100');

INSERT INTO Country (name, country_code) VALUES
('Peru', '51'),
('Israel', '972'),
('Morocco', '212'),
('Germany', '49'),
('Ethiopia', '251');

INSERT INTO Calls (caller_id, callee_id, duration) VALUES
(1, 9, 33),
(2, 9, 4),
(1, 2, 59),
(3, 12, 102),
(3, 12, 330),
(12, 3, 5),
(7, 9, 13),
(7, 1, 3),
(9, 7, 1),
(1, 7, 7);


Query : 
Select t.name as country from Person as p
Left Join Calls as c on c.caller_id = p.id
Inner Join Country as t on t.country_code = Substring(p.phone_number,2,2)
Order by c.duration DESC Limit 1

Output:
| country |
___________
| Peru    |
