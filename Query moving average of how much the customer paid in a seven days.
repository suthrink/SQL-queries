Table :

 CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    visited_on DATE,
    amount INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, visited_on)
);

(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyse a possible expansion (there will be at least one
customer every day).
Write an SQL query to compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days
window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
Return result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.
The query result format is in the following example.

INSERT INTO Customer (customer_id, name, visited_on, amount) VALUES
