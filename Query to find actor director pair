Table :
CREATE TABLE ActorDirector (
    actor_id INT,
    director_id INT,
    timestamp INT PRIMARY KEY
);

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor has
cooperated with the director at least three times.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example:

Input :
INSERT INTO ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) VALUES
(1, 1, 0),
(1, 1, 1),
(1, 1, 2),
(1, 2, 3),
(1, 2, 4),
(2, 1, 5),
(2, 1, 6);


Query :
Select actor_id,director_id from ActorDirector
Group by actor_id,director_id with Rollup
Having director_id IS Not NULL and count(*) > 0
Order by count(*) DESC Limit 1

Output:
| actor_id | director_id |
|___________|____________|
|   1      |   1         |
