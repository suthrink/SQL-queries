Table :
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_number INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_number INT
);

order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest
number of orders.
The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any
other customer.
The query result format is in the following example.

Input :
INSERT INTO Orders (order_number, customer_number) VALUES
(1, 1),
(2, 2),
(3, 3),
(4, 3);


Query :
Select customer_number from Orders
Group by customer_number
having count(order_number) > 1


Output:
| customer_number |
