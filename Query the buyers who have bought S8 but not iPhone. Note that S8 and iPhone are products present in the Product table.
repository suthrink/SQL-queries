Table 1 :
CREATE TABLE Product (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    unit_price INT
);

product_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.

Table 2:
CREATE TABLE employee2.Sales (
    seller_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    buyer_id INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    quantity INT,
    price INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Product(product_id)
);

This table has no primary key, it can have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and
iPhone are products present in the Product table.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.



Input 1:
INSERT INTO Product (product_id, product_name, unit_price) VALUES
(1, 'S8', 1000),
(2, 'G4', 800),
(3, 'iPhone', 1400);

Input 2:
INSERT INTO Sales (seller_id, product_id, buyer_id, sale_date, quantity, price) VALUES
(1, 1, 1, '2019-01-21', 2, 2000),
(1, 2, 2, '2019-02-17', 1, 800),
(2, 2, 3, '2019-06-02', 1, 800),
(3, 3, 4, '2019-05-13', 2, 2800);


Query :
Select buyer_id from employee2.Sales
Where product_id In(Select product_id from employee2.Productdata
Where product_name ='S8' );
