CREATE TABLE Activity (
    player_id INT,
    device_id INT,
    event_date DATE,
    games_played INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (player_id, event_date)
);

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before
logging out on someday using some device.
Write an SQL query to report the device that is first logged in for each player.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

INSERT INTO Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) VALUES
(1, 2, '2016-03-01', 5),
(1, 2, '2016-05-02', 6),
(2, 3, '2017-06-25', 1),
(3, 1, '2016-03-02', 0),
(3, 4, '2018-07-03', 5);


Query :
Select player_id,device_id from Activity
where event_date = Any( Select min(event_date) over(partition by player_id) from Activity) ;

Output:
| player_id | device_id |

|1          | 2         |
|2          | 3         |
|3          | 1         |
