CREATE TABLE Customer (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    referee_id INT
);

id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who
referred them.
Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id
= 2.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.


id	name	referee_id
1	Will	null
2	Jane	null
3	Alex	2
4	Bill	null
5	Zack	1
6	Mark	2


Query :
Select name from Customer
where referee_id !=2 or IsNull(referee_id);

Sol :
To select the names from the `Customer` table where `referee_id` is not 2 or is NULL, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

This query will return:

| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
