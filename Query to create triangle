Table :
CREATE TABLE Triangle (
    x INT,
    y INT,
    z INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (x, y, z)
);

(x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
Write an SQL query to report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example

Input:
INSERT INTO Triangle (x, y, z) VALUES
(13, 15, 30),
(10, 20, 15);


Query :
Select * , 
      Case 
          When x + y > z and x+z > y and x + z > y then "yes"
          else 
             "No"
      End as triangle
from Triangle
Order by triangle

Output :
| x | y | z | triangle |
____|___|___|___________
|13 |15 |30 | No       |
|10 |20 |15 | Yes      |
