CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id INT,
    team_id INT,
    primary key(employee_id )
);

employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.

Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.
Return result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Input:
Employee Table:
|employee_id | team_id|
|1           | 8      | 
|2           | 8      |
|3           | 8      |
|4           | 7      |
|5           | 9      |
|6           | 9      |

Query :
SELECT p.employee_id, t.team_size 
FROM Employee AS p
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT team_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS team_size 
    FROM Employee 
    GROUP BY team_id
) AS t 
ON p.team_id = t.team_id;

Output:
