Table 
 CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT Primary key,
    employee_name VARCHAR(255),
    manager_id INT
);


employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.
The indirect relation between managers will not exceed three managers as the company is small. Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Input :
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, manager_id) VALUES
(1, 'Boss', 1),
(3, 'Alice', 3),
(2, 'Bob', 1),
(4, 'Daniel', 2),
(7, 'Luis', 4),
(8, 'Jhon', 3),
(9, 'Angela', 8),
(77, 'Robert', 1);


Query:
With RECURSIVE Managerof 
as (Select employee_id,manager_id from employees where manager_id=1
    Union all
	Select e.employee_id,e.manager_id from employees e inner join Managerof mf 
	on mf.employee_id = e.manager_id  where e.employee_id !=e.manager_id  Limit 15)

Select distinct employee_id from Managerof where employee_id !=manager_id;


Output:
| employee_id |
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
